     * Once the onCreate() finishes execution, the system calls the onStart() and onResume() methods in quick succession.
     * Your activity never resides in the Created or Started states. Technically, the activity becomes visible to the
     * user when onStart() is called, but onResume() quickly follows and the activity remains in the Resumed state until
     * something occurs to change that, such as when a phone call is received, the user navigates to another activity,
     * or the device screen turns off.
